A webapp that uses Nginx config files to trick a website's thumbnail generator into using a custom thumbnail for links (basically, it works around the code the server has already to generate a custom thumbnail for a website by displaying it for a specific period of time).

Its main use is for customizing Google Classroom & social media posts to get people more interested in them (for example, if I post a link to my Quizlet sets, a page of the set itself with terms and definitions isn't that interesting, but a cool picture of a concept I put on my set, like a beaker bubbling with gas, looks more interesting, so people would want to click on it).

I am no longer maintaining this project because I don't have the time to continue. The frontend website Javascript definitely needs to be cleaned up... (especially variable naming)
